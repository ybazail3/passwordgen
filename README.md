# Creating a password generator

# What helped me

## This was helpful for creating random integers https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp This helped me with pushing the variables to create a password https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_push.asp and this helped me with creating the loops https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-for-loops/

# What are we doing?

## We will be creating a password generator. You want it to have options of numbers, uupercase, lowercase and symbols. The password length must be in between 8-128 no more no less. All of this to be done in a window prompt once you click "generate password". When you go through all the prompts the user should be able to create a random password once they have answered all the prompt questions.
